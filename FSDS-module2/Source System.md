# ACID properties

| Atomicity       | Everything happens together  or nothing happen at all.<br><br>I.e: You transfer money to another account, either the whole transfer happens, or it does not happen at all.                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Consistency** | A transaction must be valid (Due to business rules) before being written into the database. <br><br>I.e: If your balance is 50$ and you want to transfer 100$, your transaction must have been aborted. |
