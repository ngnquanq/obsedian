# Note
- Math is just a formalization of a human idea.
- Each step is just a rule or trick in mathematic (pattern matching). Therefore you must enrich your mathematical toolkit and learn to recognize when you can apply which rule.
- When coding, lower your expectation. Writing code isn't actually coding, debugging code is coding. 
- People fail to master ml because they give up too early (because they set their expectation too high). Somewhat mastering ML take time. Period.
