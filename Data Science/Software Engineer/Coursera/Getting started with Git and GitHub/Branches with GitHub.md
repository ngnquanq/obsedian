# Summary: Branches with GitHub

In this module, you learned that:

- A branch is a snapshot of your repository to which you can make changes.
    
- In the child branch, you can build, make edits, test the changes, and then merge them with the main branch.
    
- To ensure that changes are made by one member, do not impede or affect the workflow of other members, multiple branches can be created and merged with the main branch.
    
- A pull request is a way to notify other team members of the changes and edits made to the main branch.
