# Overview 
|Term|Definition|
|---|---|
|**Branch**|A separate line of development that allows to work on features or fixes independently.|
|**Clone**|A local copy of the remote Git repository on the computer.|
|**Cloning**|A process of creating a copy of the project's code and its complete version history from the remote repository on the local machine.|
|**Commit**|A snapshot of the project's current state at a specific point in time, along with a description of the changes made.|
|**Continuous delivery (CD)**|The automated movement of software through the software development lifecycle.|
|**Continuous integration (CI)**|A software development process in which developers integrate new code into the code base at least once a day.|
|**Developer**|A computer programmer who is responsible for writing code.|
|**Distributed version control system (DVCS)**|A system that keeps track of changes to code, regardless of where it is stored. It allows multiple users to work on the same codebase or repository, mirroring the codebase on their computers if needed, while the distributed version control software helps manage synchronization amongst the various codebase mirrors.|
|**Fork**|A copy of a repository. You can fork a repository to use it as the base for a new project or to work on a project independently.|
|**Forking**|Forking creates a copy of a repository on which one can work without affecting the original repository.|

|**GitHub**|A web-hosted service for the Git repository.|
|**GitHub branches**|A branch stores all files in GitHub. Branches are used to isolate changes to code. When the changes are complete, they can be merged back into the main branch.|
|**GitLab**|A complete DevOps platform delivered as a single application. It provides access to Git repositories, controlled by source code management.|
|**Integrator**|A role that is responsible for managing changes made by developers.|
|**Master branch**|A branch that stores the deployable version of your code. The master branch is created by default and is definitive.|
|**Merge**|A process to combine changes from one branch to another, typically merging a feature branch into the main branch.|
|**Origin**|A term that refers to the repository where a copy is cloned from.|
|**Pull request**|A process used to request that someone reviews and approves your changes before they become final.|
|**Remote repositories**|Repositories that are stored elsewhere. They can exist on the internet, on your network, or on your local computer.|
|**Repository**|A data structure for storing documents, including application source code. It contains the project folders that are set up for version control.|
|**Repository administrator**|A role that is responsible for configuring and maintaining access to the repository.|
|**SSH protocol**|A method for secure remote login from one computer to another.|
|**Staging area**|An area where commits can be formatted and reviewed before completing the commit.|
|**Upstream**|A term used by developers to refer to the original source where the local copy was cloned from.|
|**Version control**|A system that allows you to keep track of changes to your documents. This process allows you to recover older versions of the documents if any mistakes are made.|
|**Working directory**|A directory in your file system that contains files and subdirectories on your computer that are associated with a Git repository.|
# Overview of Git Workflow 
 Git workflows allow:
 - Version control
 - Collaboration
Avoiding:
- Code conflicts
- Overwriting work

# Overview of Git Commands

## Commands 
- `git init`: Sets up necessary files and data structures for project's version control
- `git add`: Add the file into the staging area
- `git commit -m`: Save the changes with a descriptive message
- `git log`: Browse previous changes to a project
- `git branch`: Create a branch
- `git checkout`: Allows to switch between existing branches
- `git status`: Allows to view the status of all changes  
- `git merge`: Allows to merge the feature branch to the main branch

- Integrate them into a single branch

# Summary: Git Workflows with Git Commands

In this module, you learned that:

- GitHub has over 100 million repositories. You can clone a repository and sync changes back to the original. You can also fork a repository and use it as the base for the new project or work on that project independently.
    
- The steps included in a GitHub workflow are:
    
    - Clone the remote repository or initialize a Git repository.
        
    - Move files to a staging area.
        
    - Perform an initial commit.
        
    - Create a branch and work on it.
        
    - Add files to the staging area and commit.
        
    - Push local commits to the remote repository.
        
    - Create a pull request for review and merging.
        
    - Use the pull operation to update the local repository.
        
- Multiple roles are involved in managing a project: Developer, Integrator, and Repository Administrator.
    
    - A Developer working in a group project uses commands like git clone, git pull, git fetch, git push, and git request-pull in addition to the ones needed by a standalone developer.
        
    - An Integrator in a group project reviews and integrates changes made by others. Integrators use commands like git pull, git revert, and git push in addition to the ones needed by participants.
        
    - Repository Administrators structure how the repository is organized and how users interact with the repository. They also configure the servers needed for accessing the web services and documentation, define email and index settings, and manage the look and feel of the application.
        
- The following table shows various Git commands:
    
| git init   | git checkout | git revert                     | git-format-patch        | git fetch upstream      |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| git status | git merge    | git config --global user.email | git-request-pull        | git merge upstream/main |
| git add .  | git clone    | git config --global user.name  | git-send-email          | git pull upstream       |
| git commit | git pull     | git remote -v                  | git-am                  | git web                 |
| git log    | git push     | git remote rename              | git-daemon              | git-instaweb            |
| git reset  | git version  | git remote add origin          | git remote -v           | git-pull downstream     |
| git branch | git diff     | git-remote                     | git remote add upstream | git-rerere              |
