# Summary: Getting Started with Git and GitHub

In this module, you learned that:

- Git is a versatile version control system used for tracking changes in code and collaborating with others on software projects.
    
- Due to a distributed version control system, Git enables you to revert to the previous state or review the projectâ€™s history.
    
- GitHub is one of the most popular web-hosted services for Git repositories.
    
- Repositories are storage structures that store documents, including application source code, and enable contributors to track and maintain version control.
    
- Git repository model
    
- Primarily focused on tracking source code during development.
    
- Contains elements to coordinate among programmers, track changes, and support non-linear workflows.
    
- Repositories are storage structures that can hold Code, track Issues, and enable you to collaborate with others.
    
- GitHub enables you to create repositories, edit files using the web interface, commit the changes to the file, upload the files, and a lot more.
