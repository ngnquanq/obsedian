# Overview
|Term|Definition|
|---|---|
|Behavior driven development (BDD)|Focuses on the behavior of the system as observed from the outside.|
|CI|Continuous integration is the tests that run in the CI server when you integrate your code to let you know if you broke something.|
|High-level language|A language that makes expressing algebraic formulas easier than using a lower-level machine language.|
|Integration testing|Level of the software testing process, where you combine individual units and test them as a group.|
|Package repository|This is where your Java jar files, Python wheels, or Docker images would be stored.|
|Test cases|Help you and others know what works, what doesn't, and how to call the code. They serve as examples for using the code.|
|Test driven development (TDD)|Focuses on how the system works from the inside.|
|System testing|Level of the software testing process, where the entire software process is tested. You test a complete, integrated system.|
|Unit testing|Level of software testing tests individual units or components of a software system.|
|User acceptance testing|At this level of the software testing process, the system is tested for acceptability by the end user.|
# The value of testing
## Design principles for Apollo 
- Use a high-level language
- Divide into jobs 
- Restart on failure 
- Checkpoint good state 
- Hardware monitors the software 
- Send telemetry 

## You can only test what you know 
More and more suitable test case, the more and more the system resilient to error. 


# Why developer don't test

>"I already know it works!"

> "'I don't write broken code!"

> "I have no time!" (worst excuse)

Recommendation: after cloning a repository, one should run the test case to know that thinks still work well

# Testing levels and Release Cycle 

## Software testing levels
1. Unit tests: is my module working? Try with good data and bad data. Need intimate knowledge of how a module work (TDD)
2. Integration tests: Combine everythings, expose flaws. (BDD)
3. System tests: The whole system to make sure it works together
4. Acceptance tests: Done by the end user
## Traditional release cycle

Right and after the test stage, everything now become lead toward production. They vary through the cycle. 

# Test Driven and Behavior Driven Development (TDD and BDD) 

## Behavior Driven Development 
- Focus on the behavior of the system from the outside
- Works great for integration testing
- Uses a syntax both developers and stakeholders can easily understand 
- Higher level of testing

## Test Driven Development
- Focuses on how the system works from the inside
- Tests drive the design 
- You write the tests first then you write the code to make the tests pass 
- Keeps you focused on the purpose of the code 
- Lower level of testing  
## Outside in and inside out 
 - Behavior driven development: Test the behavior of the system from the *outside in*
 - Test driven development: Test the functions of the system from the *inside out*

## BDD versus TDD
- BDD ensures that you build the "right thing"
- TDD ensures that you build the "thing right"

# Testing case study
For example, you're trying to calculate the area of a triangle, formula:  $base * height / 2$

i.e:

```python
def area_of_a_triangle(base, height):
	return (base/2)*height
```

We should write some test cases:

Without test case, we dont know how fucked up the program really is.

**The function appears to work, yet, appear error.** 

Clearly, the function above show that it's not ready for production

Hence, this is a more robust one:

```python
def area_of_a_triangle(base: float, height: float) -> float:
	"""Calculates area of a triangle given non-negative numbers"""
	# Check if we have correct parameters type:
	if type(base) not in [float, int]:
		raise TypeError("Base must be a number")
	if type(height) not in [float, int]:
		raise TypeError("Height must be a number")

	# Check if we have correct parameters value:
	if base < 0:
		raise ValueError("Base must not be a negative number")
	if height < 0:
		raise ValueError("Height must not be a negative number")

	return (base * height)/2
```

Therefore, don't trust untested code, be defensively. 

## Final
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know:

- Testing verifies that your software will work as expected when you or others use it.
    
- Testing prevents future code breaks and compatibility issues.
    
- Testing reduces overall development time.
    
- The software testing process includes four levels: unit, integration, system, and acceptance.
    
- The level of testing that developers perform varies throughout the phases of the traditional release cycle.
    
- Test cases drive code design in both behavior driven development (BDD) and test driven development (TDD).
    
- BDD focuses on the system from the outside in, while TDD focuses on the system from the inside out.
    
- Developers use BDD for integration and acceptance testing but use TDD for unit testing.
    
- Test cases help developers identify and fix parts of their code that can break.
