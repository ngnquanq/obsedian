# The value of testing
## Design principles for Apollo 
- Use a high-level language
- Divide into jobs 
- Restart on failure 
- Checkpoint good state 
- Hardware monitors the software 
- Send telemetry 

## You can only test what you know 
More and more suitable test case, the more and more the system resilient to error. 


# Why developer don't test

>"I already know it works!"

> "'I don't write broken code!"

> "I have no time!" (worst excuse)

Recommendation: after cloning a repository, one should run the test case to know that thinks still work well

# Testing levels and Release Cycle 

## Software testing levels
1. Unit tests: is my module working? Try with good data and bad data. Need intimate knowledge of how a module work (TDD)
2. Integration tests: Combine everythings, expose flaws. (BDD)
3. System tests: The whole system to make sure it works together
4. Acceptance tests: Done by the end user
## Traditional release cycle

Right and after the test stage, everything now become lead toward production. They vary through the cycle. 

# Test Driven and Behavior Driven Development (TDD and BDD) 

## Behavior Driven Development 
- Focus on the behavior of the system from the outside
- Works great for integration testing
- Uses a syntax both developers and stakeholders can easily understand 
- Higher level of testing

## Test Driven Development
- Focuses on how the system works from the inside
- Tests drive the design 
- You write the tests first then you write the code to make the tests pass 
- Keeps you focused on the purpose of the code 
- Lower level of testing  
## Outside in and inside out 
 - Behavior driven development: Test the behavior of the system from the *outside in*
 - Test driven development: Test the functions of the system from the *inside out*

## BDD versus TDD
- BDD ensures that you build the "right thing"
- TDD ensures that you build the "thing right"
