# Overview 

|Term|Definition|
|---|---|
|CD|Continuous delivery.|
|CI|Continuous integration.|
|Code coverage|The percentage of code that gets executed when you run automated testing.|
|Doctest|This tool lets you write your test in the docstrings or code comments.|
|Nose|A test runner and allows you to add color, formatting, and other test output.|
|Peek|A command to look at the item at the top of the stack without removing it from the stack.|
|Pinocchio|A plugin that adds color to the test output.|
|Pop|A command to remove something from the stack.|
|Push|A command to add or push into a stack.|
|Pytest|A Python testing framework tool that enables you to have an infinite number of setups and teardowns.|
|PyUnit|Also known as the unittest package. It is built-in to Python and is one of the two most popular frameworks for Python testing.|
|Red/Green/Refactor|The nickname of the TDD workflow in which you write a test case and watch it fail (red), then write code to make it pass (green), and then refactor to make it better - TDD tools output failing test cases in red and passing test cases in green.|
|RSpec|An extremely popular framework for Ruby that is also available in Python.|
|setUpModule()|Runs once before the entire Python module, which is a single Python file.|
|Stack|Is a data structure that implements a last in, first out (or LIFO) behavior.|
|tearDownModule()|Runs once at the end of the module after all the tests have run.|
|Test assertion|A statement that evaluates to either True or False.|
|Test driven development (TDD)|A test methodology in which your unit test cases drive the design of the code that you are developing. This keeps you focused on how your code will be called and what the caller expects in return.|
|Test fixtures|Are used to establish an initial known state before and after running tests.|
|unittest|The default Python test runner, also known as PyUnit.|
|xUnit series|This series includes JUnit for Java, PyUnit for Python, NUnit for .Net platform, and Embunit for C and C++.|

# Basic of Test Driven Development
# Benefits of Test Driven Development 

- Your unit test cases drive the design.
- Write the test case first for the code you wish you had, then write the code to make the tests pass. 
- Keeps you focused on the purpose of the code 

## Basic TDD workflow

- RED: Write a test case that fails 
- GREEN: Write code to make it pass 
- REFACTOR: Improve the code quality 
=> This is the loop (RED/GREEN/REFACTOR)

## Why TDD important for DevOps? 
- Saves time when developing
- Allows you to code faster with more confidence
- Ensures that the code is working as expected
- Ensures that future changes dont break your code 
- In order to create a DevOps CI/CD pipeline, all testing must be automated 
## Tools for TDD 
### Automated testing 
- Frees developers from manual testing
- Changes how developers write tests 
### Popular testing frameworks 
- xUnit series 
- Jasmine for JS
- Mocha for Node.js
=> Find a frameworks for the framework you use and test it
### Popular Python testing frameworks 
- PyUnit 
- Pytest
- Doctest
- RSpec 

Other Python testing tools:
- Nose 
- Coverage 

# Summary and highlights

Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:

- In TDD, test cases drive code design.
    
- The Red/Green/Refactor workflow includes three steps:
    
    - Write a failing unit test case for the code you wish you had
        
    - Write just enough code to pass this test case
        
    - Refactor the code to improve its quality
        
- TDD saves development time and ensures that the code works as expected.
    
- To create a DevOps pipeline, you must automate all testing.
    
- The xUnit series is one of the most popular testing frameworks for TDD, while others include Jasmine for JavaScript, Mocha for Node.js, and SimpleTest for PHP.
    
- The two most popular testing frameworks for Python are PyUnit and Pytest. Two other popular testing frameworks for Python are Doctest and RSpec.
    
- Nose is a Python test runner that can add color to test output and call the code coverage tool.

# Methods for Test Driven Development 

# Running Tests with Nose 
There're 2 ways for test python
1. unittest
2. Nose (because it sniff the bug inside the code) + Pinocchio ( a plugin) => It has nicely formatted output 

# Anatomy of a Test Case
## Stacks 
A stack is a data structure that implements LIFO behavior 
```python
from unittest import TestCase
from stack import Stack 

Class StackTestCase(TestCase):
	# Test fixture allows you to specify the state of the system before the test even start
	def setUp(self):
		self.stack = Stack()
	def tearDown(self):
		self.stack = None
	def test_push(self):
		self.stack.push(9)
		self.assertEqual(self.stack.peek(), 9)
	def test_pop(self)
		self.stack.push(9)
		self.assertEqual(self.stack.peek(), 9)
		self.assertTrue(self.stack.isEmpty())
```
Notice that every method that started with test_* will be considered as the test case. `tearDown` will be called every test case

# Writing Test Assertions 
## Assertions
- Statements that evaluate to True or False 
- Checks to determine if the results of the test passed or failed 
- Raise an exception if False, marking the test as failed 
## Example
```python
answer = sum(3,2)
assert(answer == 5)
```
## Options for python assertions 
- Python `assert()` function
- Extra TestCase asserts 
	- Nicer
	- Easier to raed 
## Common asserttions for PyUnit

# Text Fixtures 
- Establish an initial state 
- Run tests in isolation 
- Ensure repeatable results 
- Uses:
	- Preaparation of input data
	- Setup/creation of fake or mock objects 
	- Loading a database with a known set of data 
	- Copying a specific known set of files 
- Operate at three levels of specificity:
	- Module
	- Test case
	- Test

## Test fixtures in PyUnit 

![[Pasted image 20240410111422.png]]

## Example for testing user accounts: 
```python
class TestAccountModel(TestCase):

	@classmethod
	def setUpClass(cls):
		app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] = DATABASE_URI
		Account.init_db(app) #Connect to database
		
	@classmethod
	def tearDownClass(cls):
		db.session.close() # Disconnect from the database
		
	def setUp(self):
		db.drop_all() # Clean up the last tests
		db.create_all() # Create new empty tables 
		
	def tearDown(self): 
		db.session.remove() #Close session
		db.drop_all() # remove tables
```

## Test fixtures folder
`tests`
	`test_models.py`
	`test_routes.py`
	`fixtures`
		`account_data.json`

### Load fixture data example 
```python
ACCOUNT_DATA = {}

@classmethod
def setUpClass(cls):
	"""Load data needed by tests"""
	global ACCOUNT_DATA

	with open('tests/fixtures/account_data.json') as json_data:
		ACCOUNT_DATA = json.load(json_data)

def test_create_an_account(self):
	"""Test account creating using known data"""
	account = Account(ACCOUNT_DATA)
	account.save()
	self.assertEqual(len(Account.all()), 1)
	
```

- Nose is a Python test runner that can add color to test output and call the code coverage tool
    
- To run TDD tests in Bash, you can call unittest or nosetests if Nose is installed
    
- Unlike unittest, Nose can color code test results, report code coverage, and list missing test cases
    
- Testing frameworks provide tools that simplify testing conditions
    
- Assertions are checks to determine if tests have passed or failed
    
- To create assertions in Python, developers can use the assert () function or any additional PyUnit asserts
    
- Happy paths verify that a function returns positive outcomes when expected, while sad paths confirm that a function responds to exceptions appropriately and without breaking
    
- Test fixtures establish a known initial state before and after each test
    
- Test fixtures are helpful for many testing situations, such as creating mock objects and loading a database with a known data set
    
- Test fixtures operate at three levels of specificity:
