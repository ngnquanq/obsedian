# What is Behavior Driven Development 
- Focuses on the behavior of the system from the outside 
- Works great for integration testing 
- Uses a syntax both developers and stakeholders can easily understand 
- We can fit BDD in:
	- Intergrating step
	- Testing step
	- Acceptance step 

# Benefits of BDD 
- Uses a single syntax that everyone can easily understand 
- Notations are closer to everyday language than TDD and have a shallower learning curve (Gherkin syntax)

## Benefits from BDD specifications 
- Tools afford the automatic generation of technical documentation from specifications 
- You can generate tests to confirm the behavior was implemented 

# BDD Workflow and Gherkin syntax 

- Explore the problem domain and collaborate to produce concrete examples 
- Use behave to run those examples as automated tests 
- Behave tells you which examples are implemented and working 
- You now have one document that acts as both the specification and the tests for your software 

## Gherkin syntax 
1. **Given a set of preconditions:** Conditions required to put the system into the state needed to perform the tests 
2. **When an event occur:** Actions that the user takes to interact with the system under test 
3. **Then some testable outcome is observed:** Expected outcome of the actions that the user performs 

## And and But keywords

# Example of Behavior Driven Development 

## Features 
- Features represent user stories
- You can have as many features as needed

## Feature syntax 
```BDD
Feature: <title> 

As a <role> 
I want <functionality> 
So that <benefit> 
```

## Scenarios 
- A situation that describes a single behavior of a feature 
- Each scenario formulates a complete test case 

## Retail BDD example 

We may have multiple scenarios: 
-> Scenario 1: 
![[Pasted image 20240411155143.png]]
-> Scenario 2: 
![[Pasted image 20240411155353.png]]

# Tools for Behavior Driven Development 

## Tools
![[Pasted image 20240411155511.png]]

## Behave 
- Python framework for BDD 
- Uses a plain text format
- Supports: 
	- Gherkin features
	- Python steps 
	- Environmental controls 

## Factors for selecting your tool 
1. Supported programming language
2. Supported specification syntax (such as Gherkin)

# Overview of behave 

## Feature and steps files 

![[Pasted image 20240411160459.png]]

## Using Behave
You: 
1. Set up the folder structure 
2. Run Behave 
Behave: 
1. Reads feature files 
2. Looks for matching steps 
3. Executes those functions 

## Matching steps 

![[Pasted image 20240411160703.png]]

Notice that Behave will try to find the context, no need to sort by tag name, it will automatically find by the name.

Behave find the step, and execute it. 

More concrete, Behave:
1. Reads through each scenario 
2. Processes each step's keyword and text string pair
3. Finds a matching pair in the steps file 
4. Executes that function 

# Evironment functions 

![[Pasted image 20240411161412.png]]

## Setup environment.py 
```python
from os import getenv 
from selenium import webdriver 

WAIT_SECONDS = int(getenv('WAIT_SECONDS', '60'))
BASE_url = getenv('BASE_URL', 'http://localhost:8080')

def before_all(context):
	"""Executed once before all tests"""
	options = webdriver.ChromeOptions() #Other like firefox or stuffs is ok
	options.add_argument("--headless")
	options.add_argument("--no-sandbox") # Bypass OS security model
	context.driver = webdriver.Chrome(options = options)
	context.wait_seconds = WAIT_SECONDS
	context.driver.implicity_wait(context.wait_seconds)# seconds
	context.base_url = BASE_URL 

def after_all(context): 
	"""Executed after all tests"""
	context.driver.quit()
```

# Writing Feature Files 

## Feature writing tips
- Strive for consistency 
- Consider the user experience 
- Build in cues that signal that the system has responded to the request 

## Search for pets by category 

![[Pasted image 20240411162833.png]]

# Selenium
- Automates web browsers
- Uses WebDriver, which supports popular browsers 
- Interacts with browsers just like real users would 
- Works perfectly for integration testing of services that share a common UI 

## Initialize Selenium 
1. Ensure the web browser is installed 
2. Instantiate the driver 

## Find HTML elements 

![[Pasted image 20240411163928.png]]

# Writing Step Files 

## Steps files 
- Cintain Python functions used for matching 
- Use Python decorators: 
	- `@given`
	- `@when`
	- `@then`
- When Behave finds a match, it executes that function
## Feature example

![[Pasted image 20240411165936.png]]

## Step implementations 
```python
from behave import when, then 

@when('I visit the "Home Page"')
def step_impl(context):
	"""Getting the base URL"""
	context.driver.get(context.base_url)
@then('I should see "Welcome to the Pet Shop" in the title')
def step_impl(context):
	"""Check the title for Welcome message"""
	assert "Welcome to the Pet Shop" in context.driver.title
@then('I should not see "404 Not Found"')
def step_impl(context):
	"""Check if see 404 not found"""
	element = context.driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, 'body')
	assert '404 Not Found' not in element.text
```

## Step workflow
1. Write a step for each Gherkin statement
2. Implement in python
3. Repeat 

# Loading Test Data with Behave 
## Loading test data
- Test cases need test data 
- The Background specifies the initial state 
- The problem is you must load the data manually 
- The data is in `context.table`

![[Pasted image 20240412075221.png]]

## Loading data from context.table 

```python 
@given('The following pets')
def step_impl(context):
	""" Load the database with new pets """
	for row in context.table:
		payload = {
				"name": row["name"], 
				"category": row["category"], 
				"available": row["available"] in ['True', 'true', '1']}
		context.resp = requests.post(
			f"{context.base_url}/pets", 
			json=payload)
		assert context.resp.status_code is 201
```

# Summary and Highlights

Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know:

- Behavior driven development (BDD) is a test-first approach to development that ensures that an application behaves as intended.
    
- In the software testing process, the appropriate levels for performing BDD are integration, system, and acceptance testing.
    
- BDD describes behaviors in a single syntax that domain experts, testers, developers, and stakeholders can easily understand.
    
- The BDD workflow includes three steps:
    
    - Create examples or scenarios to describe the desired behavior
        
    - Run those examples as automated tests
        
    - Write additional tests as needed
        
- The BDD workflow leads to one document that acts as both the specification and the tests for your software.
    
- To build a BDD specification, write a feature and scenarios using the Given, When, Then syntax.
    
- BDD tools like Cucumber and Behave use the Gherkin syntax, while tools like Concordion use other specification syntaxes.
    
- When choosing a BDD tool, you should consider the programming languages and specification syntaxes that it supports.
    
    - Running Behave requires you to create a Features folder for feature files and a Steps folder under that for Python steps files.
        
    - Behave performs the following actions when run:
        
        - Reads the Gherkin statements in each feature file.
            
        - Looks for matching Python steps in the steps files.
            
        - Executes the test functions embedded within the Python steps.
            
- To set up the Behave environment, you must:
    
    - Import getenv() and other required modules.
        
    - Declare global variables from the environment.
        
        - Define your test fixtures.
            
- You should follow these tips when writing a feature file:
    
    - Strive for consistency.
        
    - Consider the user experience.
        
    - Build in cues that signal that the system has responded to a request.
        
- You can use a Background section in a feature to easily establish the same initial state before each scenario.
    
- To automate web page interactions with Selenium, you must:
    
    - Initialize Selenium in the environment.
        
    - Choose one of Selenium’s methods for finding an element by type.
        
    - Specify what to do with that element.
