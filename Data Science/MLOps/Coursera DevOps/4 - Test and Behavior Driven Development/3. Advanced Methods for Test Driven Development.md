The percentage of lines of code executed during tests
# Test Coverage
## The important of test coverage
- High test coverage gives confidence
- Test coverage reports can reveal which lines of code were not tested 
## Test coverage report

We dont know how those 5 missing lines of code will behave in production. 

## Full test coverage
- You must also include "happy" paths ad "sad" paths to get full test coverage. 
- Even with 100% test coverage your code can still have bugs, therefore dont stop testing when your coveraage reaches 100%  

# Factories and Fakes 
- Sometimes you need fake data to test against 
- Sometimes you need a fake class with fake data 
- Factories and fakes make this possible

# Mocking 

## Definition

Mocking is a process for creating objects that mimic the behavior of real objects 

## When should you mock? 
- Have an external service that is not under test. We can't so sure whether the system that we're trying to call crash or not? Stuffs like that. By mocking, we isolate our test code. 
- Need to change the behavvior of a dependent system under test. 
- Don't have a remote connection to another component 

> Anytime you want to isolate your tests from a remote component or external system, you can use a mock to take its place 

## Methods for mocking

### Patch
- Patches a function call, allowing simulate different conditions 

### Mock and MagicMock object
- Mocks an entire object 
- Best used as a return value 

# Practicing Test Driven Development 

## Basic TDD workflow 
An iteration process:
1. Write a test case that fails (RED: fail)
2. Write code to make it pass (GREEN: pass)
3. Imrpove code quality (REFACTOR)

## Requirements
- Create a web service that can keep track of multiple counters. 
- API must be RESTful 
- The endpoint should be called/counters 
- When creating a counter, you specify the name in the path 
- Duplicate names should return a conflict error code

## It should create a counter 
- POST method: `/counters/shoes`
- HTTP Status: `201_CREATED`
- Data equals: `{"shoes": 0}`

## It should error on duplicate 
1. POST method: `counters/shoes`
2. Return code should be equals: `201_CREATED`
3. After that, POST method again: `counters/shoes`
4. Since there's alerady a POST method above, now, the return code shoul equals: `429_CONFLICT`

## Test cases drive the development 
- Write test cases based on the requirements
- Write the code to make the test case pass 
- Use a back-and-forth process 
- Write mote tests to check now different inputs affect the behavior
