## Container management challenge

Multiple containers into a application make it harder to manage all those containers.

## Container orchestration

Container orchestration is a process that automates the container lifecycle of containerized applications

- Container lifecycle:
	- Deployment
	- Management
	- Scaling
	- Networking
	- Availability

Very needed in large, dynamic environment since it:
- Streamlines complexity
- Enables hands-off deployment and scaling
- Increases speed, agility, and efficiency
- Seamlessly integrates into CI/CD workflows
- Allows development teams to use resources more efficiently

Container orchestration is a critical part of an organizations's orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) requirements. 


## Container orchestration features
- Defines container images and registry
- Improves provisioning and deployment
- Secures network connectivity
- Ensures availability and performance
- Manges scalability and load balancing
- Resource allocation and scheduling
- Rolling updates and roll backs
- Health checks and automated error handling

## How does Container orchestration work?

### Configuration files
- YAML or JSON files configure containers to:
	- Find resources
	- Establish a network
	- Store logs

### Deployment scheduling
- Automatically schedules new container deployment
- Finds the right host based on predefined settings or restrictions

### Manges container lifecycle
- Configuration file specs inform container decisions
	- System parameters
	- File parameters

### Scaling and productivity
- Automation is used to:
	- Maintain productivity
	- Support scaling
