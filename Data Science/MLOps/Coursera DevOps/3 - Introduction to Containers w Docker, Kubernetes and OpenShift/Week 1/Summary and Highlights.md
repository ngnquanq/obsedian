Congratulations! You have completed this first module. 

At this point, you know: 

- A container is a unit of software that encapsulates everything needed to build, ship, and run applications.  
    
- Containers lower deployment time and costs, improve utilization, automate processes, and support next-gen applications (microservices). Major container vendors include Docker, Podman, LXC, and Vagrant. 
    
- Docker is an open platform used for developing, shipping, and running applications as containers. 
    
- Docker containers are not a good fit for applications based on monolithic architecture or applications that require high performance or security. 
    
- Docker architecture consists of the Docker client, the Docker host, and the container registry. 
    
- The Docker host contains objects such as the Dockerfiles, images, containers, networks, storage volumes, and other objects, such as plugins and add-ons. 
    
- Docker uses networks to isolate container communications. 
    
- Docker uses volumes and binds mounts to persist data even after a container stops running. 
    
- Plugins, such as storage plugins, provide the ability to connect to external storage platforms.
