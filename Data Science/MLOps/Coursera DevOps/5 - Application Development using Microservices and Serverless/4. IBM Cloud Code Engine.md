## IBM Cloud Code Engine 
### Challenges of self-hosting microservices
- Deliberated Configuarion and Build
- Manage Infrastructure
- Dynamic Scaling
- Communication and Security
- Logging and Monitoring 

### Example: Deploy a Python-based microservices

![[Pasted image 20240409170038.png]]

not all, also need architecture

### IBM Cloud Code Engine

- Just push the code to the cloud and done
- Fully managed serverless platform
- Runs your workloads like microservices or batch jobs

### Main use case
1. Deploy application 
2. Build and Deploy 
3. Run jobs 

### Main benefits
1. Focus on your code
2. Go live in seconds
3. Auto-scale
4. Control access 
5. Secure private network
6. Integrates with other IBM Cloud Services

## Project, Applicaiton, Build and Jobs

### Project 

![[Pasted image 20240409171103.png]]

### Application 

![[Pasted image 20240409171304.png]]
App instances are automatically scale based on workload

### Build 

![[Pasted image 20240409171459.png]]


### Job
Is an one time execution, auto scalling based on workload. Designed to run one time and exit.

## Building Container Images for Microservices

Refer to Docker and Kubertenet

### An example Dockerfile for a Flask-based microservice

![[Pasted image 20240409174114.png]]

## Deploy and running application 

### Deploying an application to Code Engine
These 2 are the same 
1. Source code repository
2. Public/Private Container Registries

2 ways to deploy:
1. Deploy via IBM Cloud Console
2. Deploy via IBM Cloud CLI

After deploy, we'll get an URL 

### Create an application from IBM cloud CLI 

![[Pasted image 20240409175015.png]]

After that, we can try to get the app

## Updating Deployed Applications 
### Common updateing scenarios
- Update environment variable 
- Update application visibility 
- Update image references or GitHub repo 
- Update runtime resources 

### Ways to update:
1. Update environment variable via CLI

1. Update environment variable via Console

## Summary 

Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know that:

- Self-hosted microservices can be very complex and challenging
    
- IBM Cloud Code Engine is a fully managed platform that takes care of all the hard deployment work, allowing developers to focus on their code
    
- IBM Cloud Code Engine has three main use cases: 1) deploy applications, 2) build and deploy applications, and 3) run jobs
    
- A project is a grouping of Code Engine entities such as applications, jobs, and builds
    
- An application runs your code to serve HTTP requests or to create WebSocket sessions
    
- A build is a process to create a container image from your source code
    
- A job runs one or more instances of your executable code
    
- A container is a standalone executable software unit packaged with all its dependencies
    
- Docker is a popular container building and running platform
    
- You can compose a Dockerfile to instruct the Docker platform to build a container image
    
- After the container image is built, it can be pushed to the container registry and then be pulled by its image name
    
- You can create a Cloud Engine application either from a pushed container image or a source code repository
    
- As per your preference, you can choose to use the IBM Cloud Console or IBM Cloud CLI to perform the application deployment tasks
