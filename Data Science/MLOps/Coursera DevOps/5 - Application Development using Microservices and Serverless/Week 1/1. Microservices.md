## Twelve-Factor App Methodology
Modern software development often having these characteristics:
- Delivered as services
- Centrally hosted and accessed through the internet
- Web apps, Software-as-a-service (SaaS)
- Twelve-factor app methodology is suited for web apps
	- Frequently used with microservices

The twelve factor app is as follow:
1. **Codebase:** One codebase tracked in version control, many deploys.
2. **Dependencies:** Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies.
3. **Config:** Store config in the environment.
4. **Backing Services:** Treat backing services (databases, caches, etc.) as attached resources.
5. **Build, Release, Run:** Separate the deployment process into build (create deployable artifact), release (promote to environments), and run (start the application).
6. **Processes:** Run the application as one or more stateless processes.
7. **Port Binding:** Applications should bind to a port assigned by the environment.
8. **Concurrency:** Scale by spawning new processes.
9. **Disposability:** Treat processes as ephemeral and disposable.
10. **Dev/Prod Parity:** Keep development, staging, and production environments as similar as possible.
11. **Logs:** Treat logs as event streams.
12. **Admin Processes:** Run administrative tasks as one-off processes.

## What are Microservices
Five key points:
- Microservices make each application component **its own a service**, **communicate via an API**
- Microservices allow components to use different technology stacks
- Microservices enable individual component to scale in response to demand (no need for the entire application to scale up)
- Lessen the risks with change because components can iterate independently
- Failures in one services do not necessarily impact other services

## Monolith vs SOA vs Microservices
- **Monolithic** design is **interconnected** and **interdepentden**
- **SOA** design provides seamless **integration** and **reusability**
- **Microservices** architecture give you targeted **scalability** and **flexibility**

## Microservices Patterns
*Note: Visit this page: https://microservices.io/patterns/index.html*
The microservices pattern are a lot, but most used can be included:
- **Single-page application (SPA)**: Microservices enable single-page applications that rely on **backing services to update page dynamically**
- **Backend and Frontend (BFF)**: Use microservices to facilitate different user experiences  more easily
- **Strangler**: Help break up monolithic apps into microservices
- **Service discorvery**: Help applications and services discover each other
- **Others**:
	- Enity and aggregate patterns
	- Adapter patterns

A example for BFF:

Each backend is a microservice
