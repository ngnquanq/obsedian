## What is REST
### Definition
- REpresentational State Transfer
- Flexible and lightweight way to integrate application
- Is an **architectural style** that defines how apps should communicate on a network

### Key REST Characteristics
- Requests managed through HTTP: should be able to perform standard CRUD functions
- Stateless client-server communication: each request contains **all necessary information**. 
- Uniform interface between components: 
	- API requests for resources should look the same regardless of origin
	- One identifier = One URI
	- Complete Information

## Introduction to API Gateway

### What is an API Gateway
- **A tool** for managing API
- Sits between the client and collection of backend services

### Why using? 
- Protect your API
- Analyze your API usage
- Monetize your APIs
- Present a single point of contact to microservices
- Add and remove APIs seamlessly

### For example
Some examples of services from an online store:
- Product information service 
- Inventory service
- Order service
- Authentication service
Without the help of an API gateway, this is the problem. But API gateway can remove this problem:
- Hosts can change
- Services can be scaled up/down
- Services can be replaced without being noticed by clients
### Benefits
- Insulate clients from implementation details
- Provide unified access to API
- Fewer requests to the backend
- Standard protocol to the outside world

### Drawbacks
- Complex
- Single point of failure
- Extra step

### Products
- Managed Gateways:
	- IBM DataPower
	- Google Apigee
	- Microsoft Azure
	- Amazon API
- Open-Source:
	- Kong


## Creating REST APIs
 Prerequisite:
 - Flask
 - Python

## Making API Requests using cURL and Postman

### cURL 
- Short for Client URL
- a **command line tool and library** for transferring data with URLs
- Used in CLI or Scripts to transfer data
- Multiple use cases
	- Download files from the internet
	- Endpoint testing
	- Debugging
	- Error Logging
- Support various protocols:
	- HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, IMAP
### Postman
- An API platform for building and usingAPIs
- Simplifies each step of API lifecycle
- Popular tool

## Documenting and Testing REST APIs with Swagger

._. nothing to write ._.

## Basic of GraphQL

### What is GraphQL
- Query language for your API
- Allows clients to Fetch(only) what's needed
- Language agnostic

### GraphQL terms
- Query = to query data
- Field = fileds on objects
- Mutation = to modify data
