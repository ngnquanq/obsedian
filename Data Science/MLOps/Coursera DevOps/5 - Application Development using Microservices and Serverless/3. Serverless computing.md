## What is serverless computing

Think of serverless computing as a combination of FaaS platforms (Function as a service - to run functions) and BaaS services (Backend as a service - e,g [databases, object storage, message queues])

### Serverless architecture concepts
- Abstracts infrasucture and software environment
- Code runs in a cloud platform
- Cloud provider manages the hardware and software setup, security, performance
- Biled only for usage
- Developers only need to focus on applications and code in the form of functions
### Characteristics
- Hotless
- Elastic
- Load balanced
- Stateless 
- Event driven 
- Highly available
- Usage-based/granular building

### Developer's role
- Focus on application development:
	- Build functions using a popular programming language
	- Extend functionality
	- Perform better testing
	- Optimize apps and functions
	- Improve user experience
### Cloud provider responsibilities
