## What is serverless computing

Think of serverless computing as a combination of FaaS platforms (Function as a service - to run functions) and BaaS services (Backend as a service - e,g [databases, object storage, message queues])

### Serverless architecture concepts
- Abstracts infrasucture and software environment
- Code runs in a cloud platform
- Cloud provider manages the hardware and software setup, security, performance
- Biled only for usage
- Developers only need to focus on applications and code in the form of functions
### Characteristics
- Hotless
- Elastic
- Load balanced
- Stateless 
- Event driven 
- Highly available
- Usage-based/granular building
### How serverless functions work

![[Pasted image 20240404001833.png]]

### Developer's role
- Focus on application development:
	- Build functions using a popular programming language
	- Extend functionality
	- Perform better testing
	- Optimize apps and functions
	- Improve user experience
### Cloud provider responsibilities
- Manage common infrastructure and maintenance tasks such as: 
	- Maxmizing utilization
	- Minimizing costs
	- Server management
	- Autoscaling
	- High availability
	- Security
	- Performance (low latency)
	- Monitoring and Logging

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- Reduced costs
- Built-in HA and FT
- Increased dev productivity
- Code runs when triggered
- Fast run time
- Built-in code editor (IDE)
- Pay as you go 
- Language indepentdent
- Third-party auth and DB services
- Faster time to market
- Innovate and experiment
- Green computing

### Cons 
- Unsuitable for long-running processes
- Vendor lock-in risks
- Cold starts
- Latency unsuitable for time-critical apps
- Security concerns 
- Complex monitoring and debugging  
- Language support dependency 
- Server optimization loss 
- No state persistence 

> Build serverless first, if needed, move to containers

## Introduction to the FaaS model

### Definition
FaaS: Function-as-a-Service (type of cloud-computing without complex services, event-based)

### FaaS characteristics
- Subset of serverless computing
- Creates applications as functions
- Deploys on hybrid and on-premise 
- Stateless
- Includes functions that execute in milliseconds and are instantaneously scalable
- Lightweight and decoupled
- Billed on consumption and execution not on server size

### FaaS benefits
- Divides server into functions
	- Focus more on code
	- Reduce time-to-market
- Pay for what you use
- Functions are stateless, smal, independent pieces of code
	- Scale automatically and independently as required
	- Scale down automatically, if demand drops  
- Inherent high availability 
	- Spread across regions and availability zones 

### Serverless stack components work

![[Pasted image 20240409155048.png]]

### FaaS principles and best practices

- Make each function perform only one action
	- Make your code limieted, efficiency and lightweight
	- Functions load and execute quickly
- Avoid function chaining
	- Too many function will increase cost
- Limit dependencies on third-party libraries 
	- Slows down initialization

### Self-managed FaaS (incase dont want to depend on the 3rd party)
- Fission
- Fn project
- Knative
- OpenFaaS

## The serverless framework

### Serverless Framework
- A free and open-source framework written using Node.js

### Serverless Framework concepts
1. Functions: 
	1. The code 
	2. Independent unit of exec and deployment
	3. i.e: Saving a user into database
2. Events:
	1. Functions are triggered by events
	2. I.e: An HTTP Request, new file upload in an S3 Bucket
3. Resources
	1. Resources are the infrastructure components used by functions
	2. i.e: 
		1. A database
		2. S3 bucket
4. Services:
	1. A service is the Framework's unit organization
	2. Service is where you define your:
		1. Functions
		2. Events
		3. Resources

## Serverless Reference architecture and Use cases

### Web Application - Components
- General purpose
- Event-driven that uses:
	- AWS Lambda
	- Amazon API Gateway
	- Amazon DynamoDB
	- Amazon Cognito
	- Amazon Amplify Console 

### Front End
Comprises static content generated by Create React App using:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Images
Downloads resources that run on the client
Communicates with backend using REST API calls

### Back End
The place where the actual business logic is implemented
- Hosts logic in Lambda funciton
- Enable access via API gateway to frontend
- Stores data in DynamoDB

### User Registration and Authenticaion
In order to restrict access (each user can only interact with their own todo app):
- Registers individual users
- Uses Cognito user pool 

### Use case 1 - Event Streaming
Serverless application: 
- Deployed w/o up-front infrastructure
- Triggered from publisher/subscriber topics
- Gives elastic and scalable event pipelines that:
	- Power analytics systems
	- Update Secondary data stores and caches 
	- Feed monitoring systems

### Use case 2 - Post processing 
Examples:
- Image and Video manipulation 
	- Resize images dynamically
	- Change video transcoding
- Image recognition/AI
	- Detect shadows on passport photos

### Use case 3- Multi-language
- Can be polygot (multi-lingual)
- Prvent language lock-in
- Depend on other resources

## Popular Serverless Platforms
### AWS Lambda
- Event-driven compute service
- Responds to requests at any scale
- Offers over 200 services
- Charges are for running a function and for data transfer between services 
- Versatile 

### Google cloud functions
- Simplified dev exp
- Scales up and down automatically
- Provides Firebase for real-time sync
- Handles asynchronous workloads such as etl 

### Microsoft Azure functions
- A serverless solution
- Uses preferred language
- Promotos DevOps capabilities
- Provdies flexible pricing
- Versatile 

### IBM Cloud functions
- Promotes easy integration w other services
- Pay for what time you use
- Powerful cognitive service
- Supports high availability and disaster recovrry 
- Provides debugging services 

### Knative (open source)
- Based on containers in Kubernetes
- Avoids vendor lock-in 
- Is platform-agnostic
- Allows progressive rollouts
