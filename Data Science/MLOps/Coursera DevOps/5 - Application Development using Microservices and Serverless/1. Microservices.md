## Twelve-Factor App Methodology
Modern software development often having these characteristics:
- Delivered as services
- Centrally hosted and accessed through the internet
- Web apps, Software-as-a-service (SaaS)
- Twelve-factor app methodology is suited for web apps
	- Frequently used with microservices

The twelve factor app is as follow:
1. **Codebase:** One codebase tracked in version control, many deploys.
2. **Dependencies:** Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies.
3. **Config:** Store config in the environment.
4. **Backing Services:** Treat backing services (databases, caches, etc.) as attached resources.
5. **Build, Release, Run:** Separate the deployment process into build (create deployable artifact), release (promote to environments), and run (start the application).
6. **Processes:** Run the application as one or more stateless processes.
7. **Port Binding:** Applications should bind to a port assigned by the environment.
8. **Concurrency:** Scale by spawning new processes.
9. **Disposability:** Treat processes as ephemeral and disposable.
10. **Dev/Prod Parity:** Keep development, staging, and production environments as similar as possible.
11. **Logs:** Treat logs as event streams.
12. **Admin Processes:** Run administrative tasks as one-off processes.

## What are Microservices
Five key points:
- Microservices make each application component **its own a service**, **communicate via an API**
- Microservices allow components to use different technology stacks
- Microservices enable individual component to scale in response to demand (no need for the entire application to scale up)
- Lessen the risks with change because components can iterate independently
- Failures in one services do not necessarily impact other services

## Monolith vs SOA vs Microservices
- **Monolithic** design is **interconnected** and **interdepentden**
- **SOA** design provides seamless **integration** and **reusability**
- **Microservices** architecture give you targeted **scalability** and **flexibility**

## Microservices Patterns
*Note: Visit this page: https://microservices.io/patterns/index.html*
The microservices pattern are a lot, but most used can be included:
- **Single-page application (SPA)**: Microservices enable single-page applications that rely on **backing services to update page dynamically**
- **Backend and Frontend (BFF)**: Use microservices to facilitate different user experiences  more easily
- **Strangler**: Help break up monolithic apps into microservices
- **Service discorvery**: Help applications and services discover each other
- **Others**:
	- Enity and aggregate patterns
	- Adapter patterns

A example for BFF:

Each backend is a microservice

## Microservices anti-patterns
While there are many patterns for doing microservices well, an equally significant number of patterns exist that can quickly get any development team into trouble. The following are some of the don’ts while developing microservices
#### **Don’t build microservices**
The first rule of microservices is don’t start with microservices. When you determine that the monolithic application's complexity negatively affects application development and maintenance, consider refactoring that application into smaller services.

When the application becomes too large to update and maintain easily, these microservices will become ideal for breaking down the complexity and making the application more manageable.

However, until you feel that pain, you don’t even have a monolith that needs refactoring.

#### **Not taking automation seriously**
If you have a monolith application, you only need to deploy one piece of software. Once you move to a microservices architecture, you will have more than one application with each having different code, test, and deploy cycles.

Attempting to build microservices without either:

- proper deployment and monitoring automation, or 
    
- managed cloud services to support your now sprawling, heterogenous infrastructure
    

is asking for a lot of unnecessary trouble.

So, when you are building microservices, always use DevOps or cloud services.

### **Don't build nanoservices**
If you go too far with the micro in microservices, you could easily find yourself building nanoservices! The complexity of which will outweigh the overall gains of microservices architecture.

Lean toward creating larger services and create smaller services when:

- Deploying changes becomes difficult
    
- The common data model becomes overly complex
    
- Loading and scaling requirements no longer synchronize and affect application performance

### **Don't turn into SOA**
The two concepts; microservices and service-oriented architecture (SOA) are often confused with one another because, at their most basic level, both build reusable individual components that can be consumed by other applications.

However, microservices are fine-grained with independent data storage for each, that is, the bounded context.

A microservices project that morphs into an SOA project will likely buckle under its own weight.

### **Don't build a gateway for each service**

Instead of implementing end-user authentication, throttle, orchestrate, transform, route, and analytics in each service, you should use an API Gateway.

An API gateway is an API management tool that sits between a client and your collection of backend services.

This will become central to the above-mentioned non-functional concerns and will avoid re-engineering them with each service.

For using Swagger UI (using Docker images)
1. Run the terminal, run the following cl:
`docker pull swaggerapi\swagger-ui`

1. To run swagger and access the ui, run the command:
`docker run -dp 8080:8080 swaggerapi/swagger-ui`

1. Run the local host to get to it: link = http://localhost:8080/
