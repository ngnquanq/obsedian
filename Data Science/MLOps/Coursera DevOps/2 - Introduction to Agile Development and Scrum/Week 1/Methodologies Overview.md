## Traditional Waterfall Development

- Requirements
	- Design
		- Code
			- Integration
				- Test
					- Deploy

## Problems with waterfall approach
- No provisions for changing requirements
- No idea if it works until the end
- Each step ends when the next begins
- Mistakes found in the later stages are more expensive to fix
- There is usually long time between software release
- Teams work separately, unaware of their impact on each other
- The people who know the least about the code are deploying it into production

## Extreme Programming (XP)

- Based on an interactive approach to software dev
- Intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requiremetns
- One of the first Agile methods

## Extreme Programming values
- Simplicity
- Communication
- Feedback
- Respect
- Courage
