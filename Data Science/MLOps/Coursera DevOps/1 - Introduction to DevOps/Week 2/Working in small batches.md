- From Lean Manufacturing
- Faster feedback
- Supports experimentation
- Minimizes waste
- Deliver faster

## Measuring the size of batches
- Feature size supports frequent releases
- Features should be completed in a sprint ( meanning it should take less than 1 week to done with that feature )
- Features are a step toward a goal, so keep them small (so that we could have faster feedback, therefore adjust when things went wrong asap).
