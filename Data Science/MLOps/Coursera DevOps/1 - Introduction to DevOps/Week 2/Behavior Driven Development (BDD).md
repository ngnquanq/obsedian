- Describes the behavior of the system from the outside
- Great for integration testing
- Uses a syntax both dev and stakeholders can easily understand

## BDD vs TDD

Quite opposite
- BDD ensures that you're building the "right thing"
- TDD ensures that you're building the "thing right"

## BDD workflow
- Explore the problem domain and describe the behavior
- Document the behavior using Gherkin syntax
- Use BDD tools to run those scenarios
- One document that's both the specification and the tests.

## Gherkin
- An easy-to-read natural language syntax
- Given ... When ... Then ...
- Understandable by everyone

## Gherkin syntax
- Given (some context)
- When (some event happens)
- Then (some testable outcome)
- And (more context, events, or outcomes)

## Retail BDD example
- **Feature**: Returns go to stock
- **As a** stock owner
- **I need** to add items back to stock when they're returned
- **So that** i can keep track of my stock on hand

## Gherkin for acceptance criteria
- Add acceptance criteria to every user story
- User Gherkin to do that
- Indisputable definition of "done"

## Expected benefits of BDD
- Improves communication
- More precise guidance
- Provides a common syntax
- Sefl-documenting
- Higher code quality
- Acceptance criteria for user stories
