- Organizations need to have small, dedicated, cross-functional, self-organizing teams to successfully implement DevOps.
    
- Conway’s Law implies that a company’s design results are a direct reflection of the company’s communication structure.
    
- Instead of the traditional structure organized around technology, successful DevOps teams should be organized around business domains. Each team should have its own mission that aligns with a business domain.
    
- DevOps is a mindset that the whole organization adopts.
    
- DevOps solves problems caused by siloed teams.
    
- DevOps is the practice of development and operations engineers working together during the entire software lifecycle, following lean and Agile principles that allow them to deliver high-quality results.
    
- Actions without consequences can lead to apathy.
    
- Allowing teams to feel the effect of their actions fosters empathy, resulting in higher-quality work.
    
- The organizational objective of DevOps is to attain a shared mindset and empower everyone to deliver customer value.

- Measure and reward what you want to improve.

- DevOps changes the objective of problem resolution from failure prevention to failure recovery.
    
- Vanity metrics may be appealing at first but offer limited actionable insights.
    
- Actionable metrics provide meaningful ways to measure your processes and take action toward goals.
    
- DevOps actionable metrics include mean lead time, release frequency, change failure rate, and mean time to recovery.
    
- You can rate statements developed by Dr. Nicole Forsgren to measure your team’s culture, including statements about information, failures, collaboration, and new ideas.
    
- Mean lead time is the measure of how long it takes for an idea to get to production.
    
- Change failure rate is the rate of failure from pushing new releases out.
    
- Mean time to recovery is how long it takes to recover from a failure.
    
- Failures are learning opportunities that should not be punished.
