Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:

- Taylorism was designed for factory work and software development is bespoke, that is, more like craftwork, and that working in silos leads to mistakes and bottlenecks.
    
- Team ownership and stable teams make software development more like product development rather than project management.
    
- Developers want innovation, while Operations want stability.
    
- Required DevOps behaviors include shared ownership, collaboration, embracing change, and data-driven responses.
    
- Infrastructure as Code is describing infrastructure in a textual executable format.
    
- Ephemeral infrastructure can be used and then discarded because servers are built on demand, via automation, using Infrastructure as Code techniques.
    
- Continuous Integration is building, testing, and integrating every developer change into the master branch after tests have passed.
    
- The benefits of Continuous Integration include faster reaction time, moving faster, and reducing the risk in integrating code.
    
- Continuous Delivery ensures that code can be rapidly and safely deployed to production by delivering every change to a production-like environment.
    
- The five principles of Continuous Delivery have to do with quality, working in small batches, automation, continuous improvement, and shared responsibility.
