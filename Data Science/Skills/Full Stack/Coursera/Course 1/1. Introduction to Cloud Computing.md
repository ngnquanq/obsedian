2. A business model with the latest trends: some cloud platform integrate tools like visualization, also bunch of AI algorithm 
3. Extra bandwith and faster internet speed: mean that you can expand your bandwidth without the need of forcing the IT infrastructure
4. Availability: allow you to change your setting anywhere, as long as having internet connection
5. Efficient marketing

## NIST definition of cloud computing
> Model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources 

Examples:

Networks, Servers, Storage, Applications, Services
- 5 essential characteristics
- 4 deployment models
- 3 service models

## 5 characteristics
### On-demand self-service
Access every day all day except for an outage or security breach 
Available without exceptions 
Examples:
- 24-hour ATM
- Vending machine
### Broad network access 
- Cloud computing resources
- Public cloud services
- Multitude of devices
- Internet access for public cloud services 
- Intranet on private cloud 
### Resource pooling 
- Saves on cost
- Computing resources serve multiple customers 
- Cloud resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned
- Regardless of the physical location
### Rapid elasticity 
- Increase and decrease resources as per demand
- Vertical scaling or horizontal scaling 
- Add or decrease reosources as per the number of users 
### Measured service

# Key Considerations for cloud computing  

## Infrastucture and workdloads
1. The cost of building and operating data centers is costly 
2. Using the cloud allow low initial costs and pay-as-you-go attribute of cloud computing add up to save up cost
## Software as a service and development platforms 
Business should consider what is better:
> Paying for application access a more viable option or purchasing off-the-shelf software and investing in upgrades

## Speed and productivity

# Lesson 1 Summary: Introduction to Cloud Computing

In this lesson, you have learned:

- Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing resources over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis; resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned among multiple users and scale up and down in response to usersâ€™ needs.
    
- The origins of cloud computing can be traced back to the mainframes of the 1950s, with virtualization technologies and hypervisors serving as catalysts for the emergence of modern-day cloud computing.
    
- Organizations must consider their business needs, investment viability, and risk capacity to create a cloud adoption strategy that delivers desired benefits without causing business disruptions and security, compliance, or performance issues.
    
- Cloud adoption is growing faster than predicted. Driving this technological wave are cloud service providers with a host of services ranging from Infrastructure, Platform, and Software services. Some major Cloud providers of our time include AWS, Alibaba Cloud, Google, IBM, and Microsoft Azure.

# Week 1 - Business case for cloud computing

# Cloud adoption - No longer a choice 

Anybody can access the computing capacity they need on the cloud from a single individual to a global multi-billion dollar enterprise. 
Cloud make it possible for business to experiment, fails and learn fast, with low risk exposure
# Expert POV: Cloud adoption benefits and use cases 

## Reason for business to adopt cloud technology:
- Impact the speed of enhancement of products 
- Meet specific needs with services already available in Cloud 
- Stand on the shoulder of giants
- Speed to build specialized stuffs

- Pay only for services you use 
- Reduce inf and op costs
- Deployed faster and scaled elastically
