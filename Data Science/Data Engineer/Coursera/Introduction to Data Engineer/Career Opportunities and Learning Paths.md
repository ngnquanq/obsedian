# Pathways to becoming a Data Warehouse Specialist

There are many possible paths to becoming a Data Warehousing Specialist. Most practitioners have a minimum of a Bachelor’s Degree in a mathematical or computational field such as Computer Science, Computer Engineering or the Mathematical Sciences. However, many practitioners instead have a Technology or Technical Diploma in a Computational or Information Technology discipline. Combining this educational background with some hands-on experience with application development and use of software for managing databases and metadata is a good way to prepare for the role.

# Career progression

The career progression of a Data Warehouse Specialist might take a direct path, such as starting at the Junior or Associate Data Warehouse Specialist role, and evolving over time through the Data Warehouse Specialist, Senior Data Warehouse Specialist, Lead Data Warehouse Specialist, and Principal Data Warehouse Specialist roles. Having said that, the path of progression is by no means unique.

Since the Data Warehouse Specialist role is simply a Data Engineering role with an emphasis on Data Warehousing, you will most likely find yourself shifting between specializations within the Data Engineering world, depending on your interests and abilities as well as the needs of the teams you find yourself working with.

On smaller teams you may need to participate day-to-day in many or all stages of the data engineering lifecycle. Working with larger teams, you will naturally find some combination of a smaller niche and career progression as the best fit. No matter your path, in order to progress throughout your career as an engineer, you will always need to be learning about and making use of emerging tools and technologies. This continuous learning will also inform you as you discover your path.

# Summary and Highlights

In this lesson, you have learned:

Data Engineering is reported to be one of the top ten jobs experiencing tremendous growth in the U.S. today. It is also reported to be one of the fastest growing tech occupations with year-over-year growth of around 50%.

Currently, the demand for skilled data engineers far outweighs the supply, which means companies are willing to pay a premium to hire skilled data engineers.

Data engineering roles in organizations tend to break the specialization up into Data Architecture, Database Design and Architecture, Data Platforms, Data Pipelines and ETL, Data Warehouses, and Big Data.

Regardless of the niche you choose to specialize in, knowledge of operating systems, languages, databases, and infrastructure components, is essential.

To work your way up from a Junior Data Engineer to a Lead or Principal Data Engineer, you need to continually advance your technical, functional, and soft skills from a foundational level to an expert level. You need to not only expand your skills in your niche area, but also into other areas of data engineering at the same time.

Big Data Engineers and Machine Learning Engineers are some of the emerging roles in this field and they require specialized skills in addition to basic data engineering.

There are several paths you can consider in order to gain entry into the data engineering field.

- An academic degree in Computer Science or engineering qualifies you for an entry-level job.
    
- If you are not a graduate, or a graduate in a non-relate stream, you can earn professional certifications from online multi-course specializations offered by learning platforms such as Coursera, edX, and Udacity.
    
- If you have a coding background, or you are an IT Support Specialist, a Software Tester, a Programmer, or a data professional such as a Statistician, Data Analyst, or BI Analyst, you can upskill with the help of online courses to become a Data Engineer.
