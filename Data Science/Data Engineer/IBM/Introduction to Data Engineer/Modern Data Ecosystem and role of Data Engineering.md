# Modern data ecosystem 
- Multiple Data Source store both structured and unstructured dataset
- When working with multiple source:
	- First step: Pull a copy of the data from the OG sources into a data repository, ath this stage, only adquire the data you need, working with data formats, sources, and interfaces through which this data can be pulled. **Challenges:** Reliability, security and integrity of the data 
- Enterprise data environment:

- Emerging technologies shaping the modern data ecosyste:
	- Cloud technology
	- ML
	- Big Data

# Key players in the Data Ecosystem 

## Data professionals:
- **Data engineer**: Extract, integrate, organize data from disparate sources. Clean, transform, and prepare data. Design, store, and manage data in data repository. Supporting Business Application, DA, DS. Skills: 
	- Good knowledge of programming
	- Sound knowledge of systems and technology architectures 
	- In-depth understanding of relational databases and non-relational data stores 
- **Data Analysts**: Translate data and number into plain language. Inspect and clean data for deriving insights. Identify correlations, find patterns, and apply statistical methods to analyze and mine data. Visualize data to interpret and present the findings of data analysis. Skills: 
	- Good knowledge of spreadsheets, writing queries, and using statistical tools to create charts and dashboards. 
	- Programming skills 
	- Strong analytical and story-telling skills 
- **Data scientists**: Analyze data for actionale insights. Create predictive model using ML/DL. Skills:
	- Knowledge of Mathematics and Statistics
	- Understanding of programming languages, databases, and building data models 
	- Good domain knowledge
- **BA and BI**: BA leverage the work of Data Analysts and Data Scientists to look at possible implications for their business and the actions they need to take or recommend. BI do the same, but focus on market forces and external influences that shape their business, organize and monitor data on different business functions, explore data to extract insights and actionables that improve business performance

# What is Data Engineering 
## Introduction
The field of Data Engineering concerns itself with the mechanics for the flow and access of data. Its goal is to make quality data available for fact-finding and data-driven decision making. 

The world of data has grown to include wide-ranging sources, structures and types of data.
## The field of Data Engineer
The field of DE involves:
1. Collecting sources: Extracting, integrating, and organizing data from disparate sources
	- Data acquisition from multiple sources
	- Data architecture for storing source data 
2. Processing data: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing data to make it usable
	- Distributed systems for processing data
	- Pipelines for extracting, transforming, and loading data
	- Solutions for safeguarding quality, privacy, and security of data 
	- Performance optimization
	- Adherence to compliance guildlines 
3. Storing data: Storing data for reliability and easy availability of data
	- Data stores and storage of processed data 
	- Scalable systems 
	- Ensuring data privacy, security, compliance, monitoring, backup, and recovery 
4. Making data available to users securely:  
	- APIs, services, and programs for retrieving data for end-users
	- User access through interfaces and dashboards
	- Checks and balances to ensure data security 
## Data Engineering is a team sport 
An individual cannot carry a team
- Architect data management systems for collating and storing data
- Optimize data stores for high availability
- Programming languages
- Data tools
- Distributed systems 

# Summary and highglights

In this lesson, you have learned:

Modern data ecosystem includes a network of interconnected and continually evolving entities that include:

- Data, that is available in a host of different formats, structures, and sources.
    
- Enterprise Data Environment, in which raw data is staged so it can be organized, cleaned, and optimized for use by end-users.
    
- End-users, such as business stakeholders, analysts, and programmers who consume data for various purposes.
    

Emerging technologies such as Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, and Big Data, are continually reshaping the data ecosystem and the possibilities it offers.

Data Engineers, Data Analysts, Data Scientists, Business Analysts, and Business Intelligence Analysts, all play a vital role in the ecosystem for deriving insights and business results from data.

The goal of Data Engineering is to make quality data available for analytics and decision-making. And it does this by collecting raw source data, processing data so it becomes usable, storing data, and making quality data available to users securely.
