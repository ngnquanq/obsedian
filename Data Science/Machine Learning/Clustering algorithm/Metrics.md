Mainly, there're two type of **big metrics**, those are **internal and external evaluation metrics**. Each of which provide different useful information for clustering algorithm. 
# Internal Evaluation Metrics (without ground truth knowledge). 
To be clear, ground truth knowledge basically is the label of the dataset. With that being said, internal metrics are crucial when ground truth labels are not available. They provide a way to **assess the quality of clustering based on the attributes of the data itself**. 

## Inertia (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares)
