There're many OS but they share something similar, those are:
- Multiprogramming
- Time Sharing (Multitasking)
Every OS must be capable to do things above. 

# Multiprogramming

**Job** is something that needed to be executed. 

**Example:** You are a doctor, at time step $t$, you got a patient, and you treat him, but then he need to recover for the second time you treat him. What should a doctor do? A doctor shouldn wait till the patient 1 to fully recover, instead, he should move on the next person while waiting the patient 1. A doctor is said to be efficient if he manages to help multiple patient.

# Time Sharing (Multitasking)

The sharing is so fast that people think that the entire system belongs to them, but it's actually not, the gap between human receive information is much more slower than the computer, therefore, in fact, these users are sharing the system, but the system, response so fast, they're *like* being everywhere. 

**Example:** The reverse flash by running too fast, so fast that people think there're two reverse flash, but it just him, a single person running forward and backward. 

Keep in mind the word **"process"**
