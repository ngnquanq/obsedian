One of the most important services provided by the OS.

**User Interface** is something that allows the user to interact with the operating system. And it take multiple form, like the command line interface (CLI) and the Graphical User Interface (GUI).

A system must be able to load the program into memory and should be able to run that program. 

# I/O Operations

People tended to think that they're **directly control the program** but in fact, they're not, it's the OS do the job

# File System Manipulation

The operating system provide services that allow you to do something with the files, manage the files, store the files, writing, deleting, copying the files, also search for a given files, etc.

# Communications

Communication between processes

# Error dection

Many errors that may occur, the OS must be able to detect them, for example of device error, the mouse was not found, the printer is out of paper, etc. 

The designs of OS must not be failed when the error occurs, it must be designed in a way such that if an error occurs, it still run.

# Resource Allocation

It's basically mean that: **allocating resources to different processes to different users.**
