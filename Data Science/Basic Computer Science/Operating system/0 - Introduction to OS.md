# System/Application Programs
Application program are programs that are used for specific task while System program are programs used to modify the computer hardware.

__But why?__ Why do we need OS? 
**Answer:** Imagine having no OS (ref to the architecture above), if there're no OS, the User1 (which want to use some program, e.g Microsoft Word) have to **explicitly** open Word, tap into the computer hardware to do what he want to do, write what he want to drive, which is **without OS, things get complicated.** There for we **have OS to takecare all the encode stuffs**
