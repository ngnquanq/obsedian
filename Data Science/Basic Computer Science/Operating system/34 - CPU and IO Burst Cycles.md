# CPU Burst and I/O Burst

Fundamental: Process execution consists of a cycle of **CPU execution** and **I/O wait**. A process alternate between these 2 states, CPU Burst -> I/O Burst -> CPU Burst -> ...so on... until the final CPU burst ends with a system request to terminate. 

- CPU burst is when the process is being executed in the CPU
- I/O Burst is when the CPU is waiting for I/O for further execution
