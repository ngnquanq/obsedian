## Naming convention
The commit of a repo should follow these 5 steps:

1. Use Imperative Mood: Write the commit message as if giving a command or instruction. This aligns with the messages generated by Git itself for automated commits.

2. Capitalize the First Letter: Start the commit message with a capital letter.

3. Keep It Short and Descriptive: The first line of the commit message should be a concise summary of the change, ideally not exceeding 50 characters. It should be followed by a blank line if you're adding a detailed description.

4. Use the Body for Details: If necessary, provide a detailed explanation in the body of the commit message, wrapping lines at around 72 characters. Explain the context of the change and its impact.

5. Use a Scope: When applicable, include a scope to indicate what part of the project the commit applies to. This can be a module name, a file name, or any other identifier that helps to contextualize the commit.

```md

Fix: Correct typo in README

  

This commit fixes a typo in the README file where "licence" was incorrectly spelled as "license" for the US English version.

```

In order to use a paragraph kind of commit, we can use `-m` tag 2 times. For examples, after git add, when at the git commit stage:

```cmd
git commit -m "FIX: Correct typo in README" -m "This commit fixes a typo in the README file where "licence" was incorrectly spelled as "license" for the US English version."
```

Notice that we use 2 `-m` flag.
