We can create a virtual env in a fast way using this line in the root folder of the project:

```cmd
python -m virtualenv <name_of_the_venv>
```

After that, we can use that venv by running this command:

```cmd
<name_of_the_venv>\Scripts\activate
```

Finally, if we want to deactivate the virtual enviroment, just type in:

```cmd
deactivate
```
