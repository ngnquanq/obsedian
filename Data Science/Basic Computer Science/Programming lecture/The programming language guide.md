# Low-level versus High-level
When mention about the level of the programming language, we're talking about "how close to the hardware the language is and how much abstraction there is between them".

# Compiled versus Interpreted

**Compiled:**
- Requires a piece of software called a "**compiler**", which will compile the code you write down to instruction what machine understand. 
- The compiled code is then executed by the CPU
- More control over hardware aspects
- Compiled languages are very fast at runtime

**Interpreted**:
- Code is executed by an "**interpreter**"
- Sometimes complied into "bytecode" that is read by a VM. So technically, there're some "compile" step, but not compile straight to machine code but to a VM (i.e python VM)
- Less control over hardware and uses "garbage collection"
- Easier to work with and faster to write

# Statically typed versus Dynamically typed
**Statically typed:**
- Perform type checking at compile-time
- Explicitly define your data types
- If the value of x is a string, then it must be defined and can not change to another type
**Dynamically typed:**
- Type checking is done at run-time
- Assumes the data type automatically
- Less code but also more prone to errors
