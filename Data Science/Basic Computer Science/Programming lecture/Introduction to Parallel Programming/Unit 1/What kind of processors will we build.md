Notice that **the major design constant is power**.

**With CPU:**
- Complex control hardware
- Increase flexibility and performance
- Decrese expensive in term of power

**With GPU:**
- Simpler control hardware
- Increase more hardware computation
- Increase potentially more power efficient
- Decrease more restrictive programming model

**Notice:** A high performance processor is provide **short latency and high throughput**.
- **Latency:** in the unit of time, the amount of time doing something. 
- **Throughput:** Quite the opposite, it's unit is often (stuff/time, also mean that jobs/hour). Therefore it measure the amount of work in a unit of time. 

The **CPU** approach is the **lower latency**.

The **GPU** approach is **increase througput**.
