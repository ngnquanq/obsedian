## Software engineering is organic
- Software stack is constantly updated
- New features are being added 
- System behavior changes over time
- Yet we treat SE like a Civil engineering project

## The project model is flawed
- The project model deos not work for software development
- Treat software development like product development
- Encourage ownership and understanding
- Software engineering is not civil engineering
- Maintain stable, lasting teams
