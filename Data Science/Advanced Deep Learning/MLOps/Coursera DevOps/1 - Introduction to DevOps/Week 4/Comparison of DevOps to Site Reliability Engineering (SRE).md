## Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)
### What is SRE?

>"...what happens when a software engineer is tasked with what used to be called operations."
>-*Ben Treyner Sloss*

**GOAL:** Automate yourself out of a job

### Tenets of SRE
- Hire only software engineers
- Site reliability engineers work on reducing toi through automation
- SRE teams are separate from development teams
- Stability is controlled through error budgets
- Developers rotate through operations

## Team differences
- SRE maintains separate development and operations silos with one staffing pool
- DevOps breaks down the silos into one team with one business objective
- Maintaining stability

## Commonality
- Both seek to make both Dev and Ops work visible to each other
- Both require a blameless culture
- The objective of both is to deploy software faster with stability

## DevOps + SRE
- SRE maintains the infrastructure
- DevOps uses the infrastructure to maintain their application
