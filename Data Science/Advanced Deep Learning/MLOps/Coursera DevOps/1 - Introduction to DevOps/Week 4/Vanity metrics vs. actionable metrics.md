## Vanity metrics
Good for hyping you up, bad for taking it in action
- Scenario: We had 10K daily hits to our website!
- Now what? (What does a hit represent)
- What actions drove these visitors to you?
- Which actions to take next?

## Actionable metrics
Take an example with A/B testing

You know that you did, and you can take action to get more or less the same desired outcome. 

## Actionable metric examples
- Reduce time to market
- Increase overall availability
- Reduce the time to deploy
- Defects detected before production
- More efficient use of infrastructure
- Quicker performance feedback
## Top four actionable metrics
1. **Mean lead time**: how long does it take for an idea to got to production
2. **Release frequency**
3. **Change failure rate**: When you push things out, how often do they failed?
4. **Mean time to recovery:** How long do something fail and then recovery?
