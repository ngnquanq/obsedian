# Generating Steps with Behave 

## Generating initial steps 
- Behave can generate initial steps 
- Run Behave against your feature file 
- Behave seeds development of steps files 

## Run Behave against a feature file

When running Behave against a feature file, the result yield below:

Behave read the feature file, showing where are the feature, where are the scenarios, then comment that position, like the image above, but then the problem occurs with the first `Given statement` because it's not implemented yet ! Therefore Behave cannot show case whether to run it, and because of that, after that yellow thingy line, the rest changed their colors to blue and indicated some test case hasn't been implemented. 

The rest of the output is what we really looking for:

The real problem we love this output is that it's actually give us a really good starting points to but in the test file. 


# Implementing your first steps 
1. Create a steps file from the generated steps 
2. Run Behave
3. Implement the first step
4. Run Behave 
5. Repeat
